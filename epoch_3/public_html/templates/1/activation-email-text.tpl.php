Hello I'm Johnny_3_Tears and welcome to World War 2 Game.

The World War 2 Game was an online multiplayer, text based strategy war game played in the browser.
I believe it used to run in the late 2000's but went offline somewhere in the early 2010's.

I am not the owner or creator of this game, all credits go to the
original creator of Kings Of Chaosand to Richard Naddiseo from Edmonton Canada.
Richard Naddiseo created the WW2Game based on an early KoC clone.

Richard Naddiseo has the source code available to everyone on his Github page,
which I have downloaded, updated and uploaded to my server. So I am picking up where it left off.
I doubt I'll work on the game any further, it's more for nostalgia for those who used to play it.

The game is now located at
https://ww2game-3.j3t-games.com
