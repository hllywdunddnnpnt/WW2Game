<h1>Hello I'm Johnny_3_Tears and welcome to World War 2 Game</h1>

<p>The World War 2 Game was an online multiplayer, text based strategy war game played in the browser.<br>
I believe it used to run in the late 2000's but went offline somewhere in the early 2010's.</p>

<p>I am not the owner or creator of this game, all credits go to the<br>
original creator of Kings Of Chaos and to Richard Naddiseo from Edmonton Canada.<br>
Richard Naddiseo created the WW2Game based on an early KoC clone.</p>

<p>Richard Naddiseo has the source code available to everyone on his Github page,<br>
which I have downloaded, updated and uploaded to my server. So I am picking up where it left off.<br>
I doubt I'll work on the game any further, it's more for nostalgia for those who used to play it.</p>

<p>The game is now located at<br>
    <a href="https://ww2game-3.j3t-games.com">
        https://ww2game-3.j3t-games.com>
    </a>
</p>

<p>This is your activation email for the WW2Game,<br>
to activate your account login to the game using the credentials below.</p>

<p>Here is your username and password:<br>
Username: <?= $this->username ?><br>
Password: <?= $this->password ?></p>

<p>Alternately, you can activate your account by going to<br>
    <a href="https://ww2game-3.j3t-games.com/activate.php?key=<?= $this->password ?>">
        https://ww2game-3.j3t-games.com/activate.php?key=<?= $this->password ?>
    </a>
</p>

<p>This is your activation email for WW2, in case you have forgotten<br>
Once there you can choose your own password, and then start playing.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble activating, please try the "resend password" on the main page,<br>
this will resend your activation password.</p>
<p>If this still does not work you can either reply to this email or message me on discord @Johnny_3_Tears#1048.<br>
Though Discord will resort in a much quicker reply</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>Johnny_3_Tears</p>
